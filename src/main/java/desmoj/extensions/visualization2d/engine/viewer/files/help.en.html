<h2>Open and Close an Animation</h2>
This viewer is java a swing application. There is a version as desktop-
and as an applet-application. For both, all animation instructions
are stored in a commands-file (CmdsFile). The animated entities are
pictured by icons. These icons are stored in a icon directory
(IconDir). To run an animation CmdsFile and IconDir must known by
viewer. This can be done automaticly by viewer call or manually with
settings in viewer menu.<br>
For manually opening an animation, choose<br>
<ol>
    <li><code>Data-&gt;IconDir</code> to select the directory which contains the needed icons, and</li>
    <li><code>Data-&gt;Open</code> to read the CmdsFile.</li>
</ol>
After this, the viewer is ready to run the animation. To close a
animation, please use <code>Data-&gt;Close</code>.<br>
<h2>Run an Animation</h2>
With the buttons Start, Pause, Continue and Stop you can run the
animation. The same is possible with menu functions
(<code>Simulation-&gt;Start</code>,&nbsp;<code>Simulation-&gt;Pause</code>,&nbsp;<code>Simulation-&gt;Continue</code>
and <code>Simulation-&gt;Stop</code>).
With the speedbar you can specify the simulation speed. The <var>speedvalue</var>
is shown in a textfield at right-handside of speedbar. In
this field, you can set also this value directly. Alternativly, you can use the menu
<code>Simulation-&gt;SetSpeed</code>.<br>
To run an animation, we have 3 modes, named TimeFlowMode:<br>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">ContiniusFlow:</span>&nbsp;Here,
        the animation runs <var>speedvalue</var> faster than real time.
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">StepFlow:</span>&nbsp;Here,
        alle annimation-commands are grouped to command-groups that
        must run at same time. In this mode, the real-timespan between two
        groups in a neighbourhood has the same value. This value depends only
        on your <var>speedvalue</var>. Normally, this is the preferred
        mode, because in this mode the animation speed is stretched in dependency
        of simulation activity.
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SingleSteps:</span>&nbsp;Here,
        between two command-groups, you must press the
        Continue-Button. In this way, you can go step by step through the
        animation.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>View, Position and Zoom</h2>
Each animated object has a position and a view. All objects with the
same view are shown in the same viewpane. The coordinates of
coursor-position in the actual viewpane are shown at
right-handside of statusline. For each viewpane you can set a zoom property. The
zoom property is composed of a zoom center point and a zoom factor. The
zoom center point is signed as a target on each viewpane. You can shift
this point by drag and drop. The zoom factor can be changed by zoombar
or in a textfield at right-handside of zoombar. Alternatively, you can
use the menu <code>View-&gt;Zoom</code>.<br>
<h2>Additional Informations</h2>
With a click on each entity you can get some additional informations
about the history and the attributes of this entity. With a click on a
statistical-object (data-collector) you can show its timeseries or
histogram.<br>
<h2>Help</h2>
In Help-Menu there is a :<br>
<ul>
    <li>a dialog about the actual loaded simulation model. The
        informations of this dialog are specified in the constructor of your
        Desmo-J Model and
    </li>
    <li>a dialog about the Desmo-J Framework.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Menu Overview</h2>
The menu has the following structure:
