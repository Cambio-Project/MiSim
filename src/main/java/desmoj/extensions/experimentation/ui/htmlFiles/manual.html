<P><B>1. What is the Desmo-J Experiment Starter?</B><BR>
    The Experiment Starter enables you to run an experiment (or a series of experiments) on a Desmo-J model. You are
    able to manipulate the given model and experiment parameters. Parameter sets can be saved and loaded. Graphical
    observers can provide visual information on the experiment. Finally you'll be able to view experiment results.</P>

<P><B>1.1 System requirements</B><BR>
    Java 1.4 is needed to run the Experiment Starter Applet. The Applet works on Windows platforms with IE5.5+ and
    Mozilla 1.5+ (see known problems), on Sun Solaris Systems with Mozilla and on Mac OS X with Safari 1.1.</P>

<P><B>2. Usage</B></P>

<P><B>2.1 Top Buttons</B><BR>
    <B>Load</B> - Enables you to load a paramter set from file.<BR>
    <B>Save</B> - Saves the current parameter settings into an XML file.<BR>
    <B>Reset</B> - Once an experiment has been run you'll need to reset it. Only then will you be able to run a new
    experiment. 'Reset' resets all parameter to their default values.<BR>
    <B>Start</B> - Starts the experiment with the current parameter values.<BR>
    <B>Stop</B> - Stops a running experiment and creates reports (Experiments are automatically stopped when the
    stopTime value is reached). Stopped experiments cannot be continued.<BR>
    <B>Pause</B> - Allows you to pause and resume an experiment run. Observers will be updated when pause is activated.
    However, no reports will be generated.<BR>

<P><B>2.2 Panels</B></P>

<P><B>Settings</B><BR>
    The Settings panel, which is divided in two halves, shows you the current model- and experiment- parameters.
    To change a given value, click the corresponding field. Press 'enter' to complete your input.
    Make sure you enter a new name for each new parameter set.</P>

<P><B>Observers</B><BR>
    Provides you with graphical information on the current experiment. Observers will appear at the start of an
    experiment. Graphs will be updated at whenever an experiment is paused or at the end of an experiment.</P>

<P><B>Reports</B><BR>
    Allows you to view the reports generated at the end of an experiment. On the left hand side double click the
    'simulation output' folder. A new folder with the current experiment name will appear.
    Double click the new folder or single click the switch next to it to open. Four documents corresponding to the
    generated output will appear. Single click them to view the information in the browser on the right.<BR>
    IMPORTANT: To be able to view different result sets you have to enter different names in the experiment settings, or
    previous results will be overwritten!</P>

<P><B>Manual</B><BR>
    Shows this text.</P>

<P><B>3. Known Problems</B><BR>
    Some browsers (e.g. Mozilla on Windows platforms) may not find the result files. To solve this problem, change the
    output path in the experiment parameters.</P>
