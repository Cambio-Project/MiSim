<P><B>1. What is the Desmo-J Experiment Starter?</B><BR>
    The Experiment Starter enables you to run an experiment (or a series of experiments) on a Desmo-J model. You are
    able to manipulate the given model and experiment parameters. Parameter sets can be saved and loaded. Graphical
    observers can provide visual information on the experiment. Finally you'll be able to view experiment results.</P>

<P><B>1.1 System requirements</B><BR>
    Java 1.4 is needed to run the Experiment Starter Applet. The Applet works on Windows platforms with IE5.5+ and
    Mozilla 1.5+ (see known problems), on Sun Solaris Systems with Mozilla and on Mac OS X with Safari 1.1.</P>

<P><B>2. Usage</B></P>

<P><B>2.1 Top Buttons</B><BR>
    <B>Load</B> - Enables you to load a paramter set from file.<BR>
    <B>Save</B> - Saves the current parameter settings into an XML file.<BR>
    <B>Reset</B> - Once an experiment has been run you'll need to reset it. Only then will you be able to run a new
    experiment. 'Reset' resets all parameter to their default values.<BR>
    <B>Start</B> - Starts the experiment with the current parameter values.<BR>
    <B>Stop</B> - Stops a running experiment and creates reports (Experiments are automatically stopped when the
    stopTime value is reached). Stopped experiments cannot be continued.<BR>
    <B>Pause</B> - Allows you to pause and resume an experiment run. Observers will be updated when pause is activated.
    However, no reports will be generated.<BR>

<P><B>2.2 Panels</B></P>

<P><B>Settings</B><BR>
    The Settings panel, which is divided in two halves, shows you the current model- and experiment- parameters.<BR>
    To change a given value, click the corresponding field. Press 'enter' to complete your input.
    Make sure you enter a new name for each new parameter set.<BR>
    Note: To be able to use the advanced functions as described under 'Reports' below, 'reportOutputType' and
    'traceOutputType' need to be set as 'desmoj.report.XMLReportOutput' / 'desmoj.report.XMLTraceOutput'.</P>

<P><B>Observers</B><BR>
    Provides you with graphical information on the current experiment. Observers will appear at the start of an
    experiment. Graphs will be updated at whenever an experiment is paused or at the end of an experiment.</P>

<P><B>Reports</B><BR>
    Allows you to view the reports generated at the end of an experiment. On the left hand side double click the
    'simulation output' folder. A new folder with the current experiment name will appear.<BR>
    By selecting the new folder the right hand side view will be updated. It now enables you to adjust the trace and
    report output files according to your needs. In order to do so you have the following possibilities:</P>
<P><B>Trace Settings</B></P>
<UL>
    <LI>min. Time - set the time at which your trace output shall start</LI>
    <LI>max. Time - set the time at which your trace output shall stop</LI>
    <LI>Events - select one event to appear in the trace, all other events will be hidden</LI>
    <LI>Entities - select one entity to be shown in the trace, all other entities will be hidden</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Report Settings</B></P>
<P>Under this heading you will see a panel for each reporter type that appears in the reportoutput. By clicking the
    panel and cheking or unchecking the checkbox immediately underneath it you can choose wether this reporter shall
    appear in the output or not.<BR>Further below you will see a list of parameters that belong to this reporter. Select
    all those you want to view in the report.<BR>
    Leaving all reporters / parameters unchecked will result in seeing them all in the output.</P>
<P>For both, trace and report, it is possible that a preselection has already been made when the applet was loaded.</P>
<P>After you have made your settings for a trace or report you will need to click the "aply" button that belongs with
    them. Your output will then be generated.<BR>Note: The settings will always be aplied to the experiment stated on
    top of the right hand side. In order to switch between experiments select their experiment folders on the left.
    Changing an experiment may however take some time, so if you do not want to change settings simply directly click
    the documents (see below).<BR>To be able to reuse given settings save and load them with the buttons next to "aply".
</P>
<P>By double clicking the experiment-folder on the left hand or single clicking the switch next to it will open. Four
    documents corresponding to the generated output will appear.<BR>Single clicking these documents will open the output
    files in one new window. In case you want to view more then one file at a time hold down "shift" will clicking on
    the document, as this will give you an additional window.</P>
IMPORTANT: To be able to view different result sets you have to enter different names in the experiment settings, or
previous results will be overwritten!</P>

<P><B>Manual</B><BR>
    Shows this text.</P>

<P><B>3. Known Problems</B><BR>
    Some browsers (e.g. Mozilla on Windows platforms) may not find the result files. To solve this problem, change the
    output path in the experiment parameters.<BR>(Not being able to view a report- or trace- file may also result from
    not having applied the settings and thus generated the files.)</P>
