/**
 * General exception for the desmoj simulation framework. All specific exceptions extend this class, thus building a
 * hierarchic tree of possible exceptions being thrown by the framework and keeping all simulation related exceptions
 * close together. Most exceptions are thrown when the continuation of the simulation can not be determined. This is
 * especially the case with
 * <code>null</code> references passed to a method expecting valid parameters.
 * Note that these exceptions must not be caught by the user and that the user does not need to re-throw these
 * exceptions, since they all inherit from class
 * <code>java.exception.RuntimeException</code> which has the special feature
 * to be re-thrown automatically by any method.
