/**
 * Exception is thrown to indicate that the simulation has finished properly. It is needed to unlock all threads still
 * alive after the simulation has reached its criterium to stop. Users must not make use of it nor is this exception
 * supposed to be caught by users. Its use inside the DESMOJ framework is transparent because it is derived from
 * <code>RuntimeException</code> which isthe root for a tree of exceptions that are automatically rethrown by any Java
 * method thus not needing to be rethrown by the user, too.
