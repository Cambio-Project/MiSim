/**
 * Stock is the place where a certain kind of product can be stored by producers and retrieved by consumers. There is no
 * difference between the units of one kind of product, the units are indistinguishable. Producers are producing
 * products and store them using <code>store()</code> in the Stock. Consumers make the Stock <code>retrieve()</code> the
 * products to use them up. A Stock is also providing a process synchronization between producers and consumers. If no
 * or not enough units of a product are available for the consumers, they have to wait in a queue until new units are
 * delivered by a producer. The Stock has a certain capacity. If the Stock is filled to it's capacity producers have to
 * wait in a queue until consumers are arriving and taking units out of the Stock. Then the producers can fill up the
 * freed space. This is the major difference to the Bin.
 * <p>
 * The first sort criterion of the queues is highest queueing priorities first (i.e. not using scheduling priorities -
 * note that this is a somewhat arbitrary choice, as the <ode>Stock</code> combines queueing and scheduling features).
 * The second criterion, if a tie-breaker is needed, is the queueing discipline of the underlying queues, e.g. FIFO. The
 * capacity limits can be determined by the user.
 * <code>Stock</code> is derived from <code>QueueBased</code>, which provides all the statistical functionality
 * for the consumer queue. The producer queue is managed by an internal ProcessQueue.
