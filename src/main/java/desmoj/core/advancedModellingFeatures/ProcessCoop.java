/**
 * ProcessCoop is the object representing the process cooperation between two processes. It is intended that this
 * process cooperation is used with the
 * <code>WaitQueue</code> construct, where one process is the master which
 * really executes the cooperation and the other process is the slave waiting for a master to lead him through the
 * cooperation. That means that during the cooperation the master is active and the slave is passive. The action carried
 * out for the two processes together is described in the virtual method
 * <code>cooperation</code>, which is to be implemented by the user building the
 * model. This class is encapsulating the cooperation of (at least) these two processes. When using the WaitQueue
 * construct the master will be activated after the cooperation is done and the slave will be activated after the master
 * (if it has not been activated during the cooperation already).
