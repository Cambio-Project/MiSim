/**
 * Res is the place where resources are stored in a pool. Processes can come by and the resource pool will
 * <code>provide()</code> resources to them. Each process has to give back the same resources it once has acquired by
 * calling the <code>takeBack()</code> method of the Res. Res is used to implement process synchronization between
 * processes, which are using resources. The resource pool has a limited capacity. A process can acquire one or more
 * resources and use them. After usage the process must release this or these same resources to make them available to
 * other processes. If a process can not get the number of resources needed, it has to wait in a queue until enough
 * resources are released by other processes. A process can release its resources anytime. After the resourcepool has
 * <code>"takenBack"()</code> the used resources the waiting-queue is checked for processes waiting for them. The first
 * sort criterion of the queue is highest queueing priorities first (i.e. not using scheduling priorities - note that
 * this is a somewhat arbitrary choice, as the <ode>Res</code> combines queueing and scheduling features). The second
 * criterion, if a tie-breaker is needed, is the queueing discipline of the underlying queue, e.g. FIFO. The capacity
 * limit can be determined by the user.
 * <code>Res</code> is derived from <code>QueueBased</code>, which provides all the statistical functionality
 * for a queue.
