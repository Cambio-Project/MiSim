/**
 * Bin is the place where producers can store their products for consumers to come and use them up. Bin is used to
 * implement process synchronization between producers and consumers. Producers are producing products and store them
 * using <code>store()</code> in the bin. Consumers make the Bin
 * <code>deliver()</code> the products to use them up. If no or not enough units
 * of a product are available for the consumers, they have to wait in a queue until new units are delivered by a
 * producer.
 * <p>
 * The first sort criterion of the queue is highest queueing priorities first (i.e. not using scheduling priorities -
 * note that this is a somewhat arbitrary choice, as the <ode>Bin</code> combines queueing and scheduling features). The
 * second criterion, if a tie-breaker is needed, is the queueing discipline of the underlying queue, e.g. FIFO. The
 * capacity limit can be determined by the user.
 * <code>Bin</code> is derived from <code>QueueBased</code>, which provides all the statistical functionality
 * for a queue.
