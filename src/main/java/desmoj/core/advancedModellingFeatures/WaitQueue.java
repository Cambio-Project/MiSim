/**
 * The WaitQueue is used to synchronize the cooperation of two processes. One process (the master) has the leading role
 * and is performing the cooperation while the other process (the slave) is passive during this period. The slave will
 * be activated again after the cooperation is done. The master process is calling <code>cooperate()</code> to signal
 * that it is willing to cooperate as a master. Slaves are calling <code>waitOnCoop()</code>. The action performed
 * during the cooperation of the two processes has to be implemented in the method <code>cooperation()</code> in the
 * class <code>ProcessCoop</code>. There are two waiting-queues, one for the masters and one for the slaves. If there is
 * no corresponding master or slave available, they are inserted in a such a waiting-queue.
 * <p>
 * The first sort criterion of the queues is highest queueing priorities first (i.e. not using scheduling priorities -
 * note that this is a somewhat arbitrary choice, as the <ode>WaitQueue</code> combines queueing and scheduling
 * features). The second criterion, if a tie-breaker is needed, is the queueing discipline of the underlying queues,
 * e.g. FIFO. The capacity limits can be determined by the user.
 * <code>WaitQueue</code> is derived from <code>QueueBased</code>, which provides all
 * the statistical functionality for the masters' queue. The class holds a reference to a <code>ProcessQueue</code>
 * where the slaves are waiting.
