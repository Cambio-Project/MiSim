/**
 * In a CondQueue processes are waiting for a specific condition to become true. Process synchronisation happens when
 * processes are waiting in a queue for a specific condition to become true. Each process which uses
 * <code>waitUntil(condition)</code> and does not find this condition to be
 * true, is inserted in a waiting-queue automatically. Whenever something happens which might influence the condition to
 * become <code>true</code>,
 * <code>signal()</code> should be used to check if the first entity (or, if
 * the attribute <code>checkAll</code> is set to true, all entities) in the waiting-queue finds the desired condition
 * now and therefore can continue. The designer of the model is responsible that this check takes place! He also has to
 * implement the condition, this can easily be done by deriving it from the interface <code>Condition</code>. The flag,
 * if only the first or all entities in the queue are checking their conditions again, can be checked and changed using
 * <code>getCheckAll()</code> and <code>setCheckAll()</code>.
 * <p>
 * The first sort criterion of the queue is highest queueing priorities first (i.e. not using scheduling priorities -
 * note that this is a somewhat arbitrary choice, as the <ode>CondQueue</code> combines queueing and scheduling
 * features). The second criterion, if a tie-breaker is needed, is the queueing discipline of the underlying queue, e.g.
 * FIFO. The capacity limit can be determined by the user.
 * <code>CondQueue</code> is derived from <code>QueueBased</code>, which provides all the statistical functionality
 * for a queue.
