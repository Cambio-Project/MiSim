/**
 * This interface describes the set of methods an event-list carrying the scheduled events and entities in a temporal
 * order has to implement. This is a part of the framework that does not have to be implemented by the user in order to
 * get a simulation running, since the scheduler already uses the class EventVector as default EventList construction.
 * Since each step in the discrete simulation requires searching and manipulating the event-list, this is probably one
 * of the best places in the framework to optimize execution performance. Especially if special models show specific
 * behaviour i.e. primarily inserting new events at the very end of the event-list, other implementations of the
 * event-list might support faster access times.
