/**
 * Contains the implementation with the java.util.LinkedList to represent queueing functionality. The entities are
 * queued in random order. The statistic data of the queue will be stored in a <code>QueueBased</code> object. The
 * <code>QueueListStandardFifo</code> has a reference to its <code>QueueBased</code> object. This class needs a
 * reference to a subclass of QueueBased to update the queue statistics. It is used in many kinds of queue
 * implementations i.e. in classes
 * <code>Queue</code> and <code>ProcessQueue</code>.
