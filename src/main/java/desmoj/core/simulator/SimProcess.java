/**
 * SimProcess represents entities with an own active lifecycle. Since SimProcesses are in fact special entities with
 * extended capabilities (esp. the method <code>lifeCycle()</code>), they inherit from Entity and thus can also be used
 * in conjunction with events. So they can be handled in both ways, event- and process-oriented. Clients are supposed to
 * implement the
 * <code>lifeCycle()</code> method to specify the individual behaviour of a special
 * SimProcess subclass. Since implementing activity- and transaction-oriented synchronization mechanisms requires
 * significant changes in this class, methods that have been implemented by Soenke Claassen have been marked.
