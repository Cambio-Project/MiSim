/**
 * Provides the class for user defined events to change <b>a single</b> entity's internal state. The state of a discrete
 * model is changed by events that occur at distinct points of simulation time.<p> For events changing the state of
 * <b>two</b> or <b>three</b> entities, refer to <code>EventOf2Entities</code> and <code>EventOf3Entities</code>. Events
 * not associated to a specific entity are based on <code>ExternalEvent</code>.
 * <p>
 * For type safety it is recommended to generically assign the entity type an Event operates on by using the generic
 * type
 * <code>Event&lt;E&gt;</code> where
 * <code>E</code> is derived from <code>Entity</code>.
 * <p>
 * All event object should be used only once. Implement the changes of state for the specific entity associated with
 * this event by overriding the abstract method
 * <code>eventRoutine(E who)</code>.
