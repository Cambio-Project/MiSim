/**
 * This superclass for every DESMOJ class provides the ability to carry a name for identification. Gives objects the
 * ability to carry a name to be shown in reports. Each class in the desmoj-Framework is supposed to be able to carry a
 * name for identification and offer methods to reset and tell its name. Since all other desmoj classes inherit from
 * this class, it is ensured that any object, even the user's special objects, have a name to be used in a report.
 * Offering no default constructor enforces users to give each new object in their models a name. The class is set
 * abstract to prevent clients from accidentally creating otherwise functionless (but named) objects.
