/**
 * Event notes contain any information needed for any type of <Code>Schedulable</Code>, event or process. Since
 * <Code>EventNote</Code> are tightly coupled with the <Code>EventList</Code>, a change of the <Code>EventList</Code>
 * might alo force the <Code>EventNote</Code> to contain other information especially concerning the data structures
 * used in the <Code>EventList</Code> as well. To adopt the <Code>Event notes</Code> extend them to carry the specific
 * data and methods you need for a possible change of the <Code>EventList</Code>. The implementation here includes data
 * and methods for event information only, since the default implementation of class <code>EventVector</code> needs no
 * special information stored inside the <Code>Event notes</Code>.
