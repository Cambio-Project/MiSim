/**
 * Resources are objects needed by SimProcesses to perform certain tasks. Every Resource has its unique ID number, so it
 * can be identified. Each Resource belongs to a certain resource category (resource pool) and has the status ready (can
 * be used) or <code>outOfOrder</code> if it is broken down.
