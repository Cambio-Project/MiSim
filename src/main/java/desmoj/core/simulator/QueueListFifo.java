/**
 * Contains the implementation with the java.util.LinkedList to represent queueing functionality. The entities are
 * queued first according to their priority and second in FIFO (first in first out) order. The statistic data of the
 * queue will be stored in a <code>QueueBased</code> object. The <code>QueueListStandardFifo</code> has a reference to
 * its <code>QueueBased</code> object. This class needs a reference to a subclass of QueueBased to update the queue
 * statistics. It is used in many kinds of queue implementations i.e. in classes
 * <code>Queue</code> and <code>ProcessQueue</code>.
