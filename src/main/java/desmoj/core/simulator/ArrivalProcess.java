/**
 * An <code>ArrivalProcess</code> is some kind of source for
 * <code>SimProcess</code> es. It makes them arrive from the 'outside world'
 * in the system of interest. So it can be viewed as the border of the system (model). The user has to specify at which
 * rate (frequency)
 * <code>SimProcess</code> es are arriving in the system. See the Constructor
 * for more details. The user has to derive from this class to make his own ArrivalProcesses for the arriving processes
 * he needs in his simulated system. He has to implement the abstract method <code>createSuccessor()</code>, which
 * should create (instantiate) the newly arriving process. It is recommended to use one ArrivalProcess for each
 * different kind of arriving process (with its specific arrival rate).
