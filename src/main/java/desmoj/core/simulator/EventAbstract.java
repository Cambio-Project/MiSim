/**
 * Provides the abstract super class for user defined events to change an entity's internal state. The state of a
 * discrete model is changed by events that occur at distinct points of simulation time.
 * <p>
 * an event with up to three entities, changing its state according to the entity's reaction to the specific Event in
 * the system under inspection. So each type of Event acting on one certain type of Entity requires a new subclass to be
 * derived from this class. Since events are associated to a single entity, the method executing the changes of state of
 * a specific Entity gets that entity passed as a parameter. The scheduler takes care that this is done at the specified
 * point of simulation time.
 * <p>
 * For type safety it is recommended to generically assign the entity type an Event operates on by using the generic
 * type
 * <code>Event&lt;EntityOperatingOn&gt;</code> where
 * <code>EntityOperatingOn</code> is derived from <code>Entity</code>.
 * <p>
 * events should be used one time only. They are created to be scheduled together with a specific Entity, change that
 * entity's state at the scheduled point of simulation time and are destroyed by Java's garbage collector after use.
 * They could be reused but at a certain risk of inconsistent states. Since each object of a class that is derived from
 * the class
 * <code>Schedulable</code> has its unique identification number added as a
 * suffix to its name, reusing Event objects would make one event responsible for several distinct changes in a model at
 * different simulation times. This comes with the danger of of confusing the model's trace and making it more difficult
 * to debug a faulty model implementation. Each type of Event needed for a model requires a new subclass of Event to be
 * derived by the user.
 * <p>
 * Embed the changes of state for the specific Entity associated with this event by overriding the abstract method
 * <code>eventRoutine(Entity e)</code>. Events that do not manipulate a single entity but act on the model's state on a
 * more general matter are defined by external events, a subclass of this class.
