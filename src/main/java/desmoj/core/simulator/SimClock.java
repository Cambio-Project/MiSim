/**
 * The simulation clock shows the actual simulation time. The actual simulation time can be polled by any object but can
 * only be set by the scheduler responsible for the actual model. The simulation clock is extending class
 * <code>java.util.Observable</code> thus representing the 'observable' part in
 * a 'observer'-design pattern as described in [Gamm95] page 107. This enables observers to register themselves at the
 * simulation clock to be notified whenever the simulation time changes. This can be easily used to provide fully
 * automatic statistical counters. Each time the simulation time changes, a counter registered at the simulation clock
 * is notofied and can poll the value it is observing (most likely from a special <code>ValueSupplier</code> object).
 * This way, no explicit calls for the counter to update its observed value are needed. Note that on the other hand this
 * might reduce performance in comparison to explicit update call since the value under observation might not change
 * each time the simulation time is changed.
