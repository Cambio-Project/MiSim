/**
 * Supplies observers with texts of their interest. It resembles the "observable" part of the observer pattern as
 * described in [Gamm95]. Thus it extends the standard "Observable" class provided by the Java.util package. <br There
 * are two possible ways to have other objects register changes of another object's status: <ol <liCall the
 * <code"update(String updateStr)"</codemethod of an observer to pass the String to be counted directly to one other
 * object interested. Using the direct call allows easy passing of a String to a single observer. No instance of this
 * <codeTextSupplier</codeclass is needed using direct passing of Strings.</li <liUsing the <codeTextSupplier</codeto
 * publish the information to interested observers requires you to derive a class and implement the call of the
 * observer's <codeupdate(Observable, Object)</codemethod with the required texts. This way of passing Strings involves
 * more code to be written, but offer the potential to have multiple observers and change the number of observers during
 * runtime. These options are not available when using the simpler version above.</li </ol
