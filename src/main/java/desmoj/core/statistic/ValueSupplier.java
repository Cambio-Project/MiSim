package desmoj.core.statistic;

/**
 * Supplies observers with values of their interest. It resembles the "observable" part of the observer pattern as
 * described in [Gamm95]. Thus it extends the standard "Observable" class provided by the Java.util package. Usually,
 * statistical data collectors are interested in the new value whenever a certain status variable of a simulation object
 * changes. Also there are statistical evaluation systems, such as AKAROA, which extract information from several
 * running simulations on different remote computers to gain better statistical data and finally, extracting values
 * during runtime enables better visualizatioin of the simulation progress if these values are displayed using a
 * graphical interface. There are two possible ways to have other objects register changes of another object's status:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Call the <code>"update(double value)"</code> method of an observer to
 * pass the changed value directly to one other object interested. Using the
 * direct call allows easy passing of a value to a single observer. No instance
 * of this <code>ValueSupplier</code> class is needed using direct passing of
 * values.</li>
 * <li>Using the <code>ValueSupplier</code> to publish the information to
 * interested observers requires you to derive a class and implement the call of
 * the observer's <code>update(Observable, Object)</code> method with the
 * required values. This way of passing values involves more code to be written,
 * but offer the potential to have multiple observers and change the number of
 * observers during runtime. These options are not available when using the
 * simpler version above.</li>
 * </ol>
