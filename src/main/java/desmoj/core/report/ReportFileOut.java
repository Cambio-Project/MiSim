/**
 * ReportFileOut is used to create a file to let the reporters write their reports to. It receives a reporter and
 * divides its individual text information up to be displayed in HTML format on disc in the user's local directory. The
 * messages are displayed in a tabular design with columns for each item displayed by the reporter. For each Reporter
 * giving a new group-ID, a new table is opened. This leads to a number of distinct tables displayed in one HTML-page
 * with all reporters grouped by their group-id in one table. Note that if the framework is used as an Applet in
 * webpages there is no access to the disc and an alternative output on screen or into a graphics window must be
 * registered at the Experiment's MessageManager for this type of messages. Errors affecting the java runtime are always
 * displayed on the system's standard output PrintStream.
