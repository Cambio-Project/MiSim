/**
 * FileOutput is the class all other writer-based Output classes used within the DESMO-j framework are derived from. The
 * basic functionality needed for all FileOutput objects are methods to open and close the stream used for output and
 * set the two necessary types of separators for column output. Two methods for writing Strings into the file are
 * supported. The name is needed for opening a file to identify the output channel in terms of window titles or file
 * names, depending on the type of output the specific subclass relies on. Note that each object of this class supports
 * the creation of several files in a row. You can open and close as many files as needed with one object.
 * <p>
 * Users of this class dont necessarily have to write to real files on disk, see {@link #setFileSystemAccess}.
