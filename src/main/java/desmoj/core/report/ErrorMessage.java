/**
 * An ErrorMessage is used to signal invalid situations to the modeller. An ErrorMessage consists of four Strings that
 * intend to define the kind of error that occurred and describe its reason and what a modeller can do to prevent it.
 * ErrorMessages describe types of errors that can be fixed by the DESMO-J or just give hints on missing or unclear
 * parameters where certain framework assumptions are made. ErrorMessages report these to the modeller. Any type of
 * error consists of the following attributes which have to be set by the ErrorMessage's constructor:
 * <ul>
 * <li>error description : The operation that just failed or does not have the
 * preconditions matched</li>
 * <li>error location : The class and method that the error occurred in</li>
 * <li>error reason : The probable reason why the error occured</li>
 * <li>error prevention : A hint on how to prevent this error to occur again.
 * </li>
 * <li>error time : The point of simulation time that the error occurred.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Note that ErrorMessages relate to the modeller's use of the framework's
 * methods and correct the found problems if possible by making assumptions.
 * These corrections and their assumptions are articulated by an ErrorMessage.
 * In contrast to <code>Exceptions</code> and fatal errors, an ErrorMessage
 * does not stop the simulation run or exit the Java runtime.
