/**
 * Empirically distributed stream of pseudo random numbers of type
 * <code>double</code>. Values produced by this distribution follow an empirical
 * distribution which is specified by entries consisting of the observed value and the frequency (probability) this
 * value has been observed to occur. These entries are made by using the <code>addEntry()</code> method. There are a few
 * conditions a user has to meet before actually being allowed to take a sample of this distribution.
