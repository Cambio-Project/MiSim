/**
 * Base class for all pseudo random number distributions used in this package. Defines a set of methods usefull for all
 * kinds of random distributions that can be based upon a stream of uniform distributed pseudo random numbers.
 * Prefabricated distributions implemented in this package can handle uniform, normal (gaussian), bernoulli, poisson and
 * heuristic distributions with return values of the primitive data types double (floating point), long (integer) and
 * boolean (true or false). Inherit from this class if you want to implement new types of distributions handing back
 * values of other types than those listed above. Basic idea is to use a pseudo random generator which produces a
 * uniformly distributed stream of double numbers between 0 and 1 use inverse transformation to generate the desired
 * distribution. See also [Page91, p. 107] Note that although this class implements all methods, it is set to be
 * abstract, since instantiating this class would not produce any meaningfull distribution to be used by a client.
