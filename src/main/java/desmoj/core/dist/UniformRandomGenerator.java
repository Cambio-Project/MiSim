/**
 * Interface for uniform pseudo random number generators to be used by the distribution classes to compute their
 * samples. Random generators of this type must return uniform distributed double values. Note that two constructors
 * have to be implemented. One constructor without parameters to construct a UniformRandomGenerator with seed zero, and
 * another constructor with a parameter of type long to pass the initial seed value to the pseudo random generation
 * algorithm.
